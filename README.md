# Traffic-Light-Control-System.202401100400156 
Introduction
The Traffic Light Control System is a project designed to simulate the working of a real-world traffic signal using Python and Tkinter. It follows a predefined sequence of red, yellow, and green lights to regulate the movement of vehicles and pedestrians efficiently. This system ensures smooth traffic flow and enhances road safety.

Features
Sequential light changes with appropriate time intervals.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

Automated cycle of red, yellow, and green lights.

Non-blocking execution using window.after() for smooth performance.

Methodology
Design & Planning: Define the traffic light phases and time delays.

Implementation: Develop the GUI and logic for sequential light control.

Simulation: Run a Python-based model using Tkinter.

Testing & Optimization: Ensure the correct timing and responsiveness.

Deployment & Monitoring: Integrate with real-world applications if needed.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python).

Steps to Run the Program:
Clone or Download the repository.

Navigate to the project folder.

Run the script:

python traffic_light.py
Click the Start button to begin the simulation.

Usage
The system starts with a red light (Stop).

After 3 seconds, the yellow light (Get Ready) turns on.

After 1 second, the green light (Go) activates.

The cycle repeats automatically.

Future Enhancements
Sensor-based adaptive signals for real-time traffic management.

Integration with AI & IoT for smart city applications.

Pedestrian crossing signals for enhanced safety.

Conclusion
The Traffic Light Control System provides a basic yet effective simulation of real-world traffic lights. It serves as a foundation for developing more advanced, AI-powered traffic management systems.
